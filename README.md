# Stadium Operations & Labor Optimization

### Executive Summary
This project analyzes historical attendance and staffing data to optimize labor allocation for a major stadium venue. By utilizing **R** for predictive modeling and **SQL** for data aggregation, I identified inefficiencies in staffing during low-attendance events. The final **Tableau** dashboard provides operations managers with actionable heat maps to reduce overstaffing costs by ~15% while maintaining service levels.

### Tools Used
* **R (Tidyverse, ggplot2):** Data cleaning and linear regression modeling.
* **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Complex joins and window functions for temporal analysis.
* **Tableau:** Interactive dashboarding for labor heat maps.

* `stadium_queries.sql`: SQL queries used to aggregate monthly labor demand.
